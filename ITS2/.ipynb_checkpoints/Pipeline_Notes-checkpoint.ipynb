    "Running dada2 settings under default QIIME2 settings resulted in 1031 OTUs total, whereas making my own custom dada2 script, I had almost 3x that, 2786 OTUs.\n",
    "Those additional OTUs almost definitely included some plants (62 in the default, 257 in the custom).\n",
    "The error figures didn't get way better, I don't think, but both followed the basic expected shape.\n",
    "It made more sense to see more OTUs ID'd as morels in the custom pathway. However, it seemed like we were maybe missing some of the species that were ID'd in the basic run, so that seems weird.\n",
    "One option would be to consolidate at the genus level for fungi. However, that only works for taxa classified down to genus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of thinking about it is, did the samples match anything in the UNITE database? \n",
    "\n",
    "Custom had 2709636 sequences\n",
    "Initial had 2302796 sequences\n",
    "So... not that big of a change, actually - 20% more sequences, but 300% more OTUs. So lots of singletons.\n",
    "So, that said, tightening some of the parameters might improve OTU quality in some ways without losing a lot of seqs."
